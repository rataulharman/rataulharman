# 👋 Hi, I'm Harman Rataul!!!


Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a student in the Software Development program at MITT.  
I really enjoy learning how websites and applications work. I’m currently learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and I like building small projects to practice. Coding is new to me, but I find it exciting and fun to see my work come to life on the screen.

Besides programming, I also enjoy **video editing**, **photo editing**, and playing **cricket** in my free time. I like doing creative things and always try to learn new skills. My goal is to keep improving as a developer and one day build projects that can help people or make a difference.
